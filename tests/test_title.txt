19938376	Plant caspase-like proteases in plant programmed cell death.	Programmed cell death (PCD) is a genetically-controlled disassembly of the cell. In animal systems, the central core execution switch for apoptotic PCD is the activation of caspases (Cysteine-containing Aspartate-specific proteases). Accumulating evidence in recent years suggests the existence of caspase-like activity in plants and its functional involvement in various types of plant PCD, although no functional homologs of animal caspases were identified in plant genome. In this mini-review, we will cover the recent results on the existence of plant caspase-like proteases and introduce major technologies used in detecting the activation of caspase-like proteases during plant PCD.
19847124	The ER body, a new organelle in Arabidopsis thaliana, requires NAI2 for its formation and accumulates specific beta-glucosidases.	Plants develop various ER-derived structures with specific functions. The ER body found in Arabidopsis thaliana is a spindle-shaped structure. ER bodies accumulate in epidermal cells in seedlings or are induced by wounding. The molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of the ER body remained obscure. We isolated an ER body-deficient mutant in Arabidopsis seedlings, which we termed nai2. The NAI2 gene encodes a member of a unique protein family. NAI2 localizes to the ER body and the downregulation of NAI2 elongates ER bodies and reduces their number. ER bodies specifically accumulate high levels of PYK10/BGLU23, which is a beta-glucosidase that bears an ER retention signal. Additionally, in the nai2 mutant, PYK10 protein is diffuse throughout the ER and the PYK10 protein level is reduced. These observations indicate that NAI2 is a key factor for the formation of ER bodies and for the accumulation of PYK10 in the ER bodies of Arabidopsis. We also found that BGLU18, which encodes another beta-glucosidase with an ER retention signal, is induced at the site of wounding. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the BGLU18 protein is exclusively localized in ER bodies formed directly at the wounding site of cotyledons. These results suggest that BGLU18 is a component of the ER body in wounded leaves of Arabidopsis.
19847117	Biomechanics of climbing palms and how they climb.	Climbing plants have fascinated botanists since the pioneering works of Darwin and his contemporaries in the 19(th) century. Diverse plants have evolved different ways of climbing and a wide range of attachment devices and stem biomechanics to cope with the particular physical demands of life as a climber. We investigated the biomechanics of attachment in a range of climbing palms, including true rattans from Southeast Asia and the genus Desmoncus from South America. We found that hook strength and orientation is coordinated with rachis geometry and rigidity. These findings support the notion of a ratchet-type attachment mechanism and partly explain why these spiny plants are so catchy and efficient at attaching to supports.
19847112	Intracellular Ca2+ stores could participate to abscisic acid-induced depolarization and stomatal closure in Arabidopsis thaliana.	In Arabidopsis thaliana cell suspension, abscisic acid (ABA) induces changes in cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](cyt)) which are the trigger for ABA-induced plasma membrane anion current activation, H(+)-ATPase inhibition, and subsequent plasma membrane depolarization. In the present study, we took advantage of this model to analyze the implication of intracellular Ca(2+) stores in ABA signal transduction through electrophysiological current measurements, cytosolic Ca(2+) activity measurements with the apoaequorin Ca(2+) reporter protein and external pH measurement. Intracellular Ca(2+) stores involvement was determined by using specific inhibitors of CICR channels: the cADP-ribose/ryanodine receptor (Br-cADPR and dantrolene) and of the inositol trisphosphate receptor (U73122). In addition experiments were performed on epidermal strips of A. thaliana leaves to monitor stomatal closure in response to ABA in presence of the same pharmacology. Our data provide evidence that ryanodine receptor and inositol trisphosphate receptor could be involved in ABA-induced (1) Ca(2+) release in the cytosol, (2) anion channel activation and H(+)-ATPase inhibition leading to plasma membrane depolarization and (3) stomatal closure. Intracellular Ca(2+) release could thus contribute to the control of early events in the ABA signal transduction pathway in A. thaliana.
19820356	Carbon and nitrogen nutrient balance signaling in plants.	Cellular carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) metabolism must be tightly coordinated to sustain optimal growth and development for plants and other cellular organisms. Furthermore, C/N balance is also critical for the ecosystem response to elevated atmospheric CO(2). Despite numerous physiological and molecular studies in C/N balance or ratio response, very few genes have been shown to play important roles in C/N balance signaling. During recent five years, exciting progress was made through genetic and genomic studies. Several DNA microarray studies have shown that more than half of the transcriptome is regulated by C, N and the C-N combination. Three genetic studies involving distinct bioassays have demonstrated that a putative nitrate transporter (NTR2.1), a putative glutamate receptor (GLR1.1) and a putative methyltransferase (OSU1) have important functions in the C/N balance response. OSU1 is identical to QUA2/TSD2 which has been implicated to act in cell wall biogenesis, indicating a link between cell wall property and the C/N balance signaling. Given that many investigations are only focused on C alone or N alone, the C/N balance bioassays and gene expression patterns are discussed to assist phenotypic characterization of C/N balance signaling. Further, re-examination of those previously reported sugar or nitrogen responsive genes in C/N balance response may be necessary to dissect the C/N signaling pathways. In addition, key components involved in C-N interactions in bacterial, yeast and animal systems and whether they are functionally conserved in plants are discussed. These rapid advances have provided the first important step towards the construction of the complex yet elegant C/N balance signaling networks in plants.
19820354	Floral initiation process at the soybean shoot apical meristem may involve multiple hormonal pathways.	Flowering and seed set underpin most of the agriculture production. In the 57 Issue of The Plant Journal, we analysed the gene expression changes in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) during the transition from vegetative to flowering phase in soybean, an important legume crop. We identified a number of genes that are actively transcribed or repressed during the transition to flowering and the annotation of which have allowed us to infer the involvement of at least three hormonal pathways: those that involve abscisic acid (ABA), auxin and jasmonic acid (JA) in the regulation of floral initiation process in soybean. Intriguingly, the induction of known floral homeiotic transcript that includes APETALA1 in the SAM occurred after the induction of these hormonal transcripts adding a likely novel biochemical dimension to the current understanding of floral regulatory pathways. In view of recent studies, a cross-regulatory mechanism involving these hormones is proposed to operate at the SAM to initiate flowering.
19816126	Callose synthesis in higher plants.	Callose is a polysaccharide in the form of beta-1,3-glucan with some beta-1,6-branches and it exists in the cell walls of a wide variety of higher plants. Callose plays important roles during a variety of processes in plant development and/or in response to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. It is now generally believed that callose is produced by callose synthases and that it is degraded by beta-1,3-glucanases. Despite the importance of callose in plants, we have only recently begun to elucidate the molecular mechanism of its synthesis. Molecular and genetic studies in Arabidopsis have identified a set of genes that are involved in the biosynthesis and degradation of callose. In this mini-review, we highlight recent progress in understanding callose biosynthesis and degradation and discuss the future challenges of unraveling the mechanism(s) by which callose synthase operate.
19816102	Assessing fungal root colonization for plant improvement.	Fungal endophytes display a broad range of symbiotic interactions with their host plants. Current studies on their biology, diversity and benefits are unravelling their high relevance on plant adaptation to environmental stresses. Implementation of such properties may open new perspectives in agriculture and forestry. We aim to exploit the endophytic capacities of the fungal species Fusarium equiseti, a naturally occurring root endophyte which has shown antagonism to plant pathogens, and Pochonia chlamydosporia, a nematophagous fungus with putative endophytic behavior, for plant protection and adaptation to biotic and abiotic stress. A real-time PCR protocol for quantification of the fungal population, together with Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation with the GFP gene for confocal microscopy analyses, were designed and applied to assess endophytic development of both these fungal species. Although quantification of both F. equiseti and P. chlamydosporia yielded similar degrees of root colonization, microscopical observations demonstrated differences in infection and development patterns. Furthermore, we found evidences of plant response against endophyte colonization, supporting a balanced antagonism between the endophyte virulence and the plant defenses. Optimization and application of the methodologies presented herein will allow elucidation of beneficial interactions among these endophytes and their host plants.
19816097	Isolation of high salinity stress tolerant genes from Pisum sativum by random overexpression in Escherichia coli and their functional validation.	Salinity stress is one of the major factors which reduce crop plants growth and productivity resulting in significant economic losses worldwide. Therefore, it would be fruitful to isolate and functionally identify new salinity stress-induced genes for understanding the mechanism and developing salinity stress tolerant plants. Based on functional gene screening assay, we have isolated few salinity tolerant genes out of one million Escherichia coli (SOLR) transformants containing pea cDNAs. Sequence analysis of three of these genes revealed homology to Ribosomal-L30E (RPL30E), Chlorophyll-a/b-binding protein (Chla/bBP) and FIDDLEHEAD (FDH). The salinity tolerance of these genes in bacteria was further confirmed by using another strain of E. coli (DH5alpha) transformants. The homology based computational modeling of these proteins suggested the high degree of conservation with the conserved domains of their homologous partners. The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that the expression of these cDNAs (except the FDH) was upregulated in pea plants in response to NaCl stress. We observed that there was no significant effect of Li(+) ion on the expression level of these genes, while an increase in response to K(+) ion was observed. Overall, this study provides an evidence for a novel function of these genes in high salinity stress tolerance. The PsFDH showed constitutive expression in planta suggesting that it can be used as constitutively expressed marker gene for salinity stress tolerance in plants. This study brings new direction in identifying novel function of unidentified genes in abiotic stress tolerance without previous knowledge of the genome sequence.
19805217	Identification of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in Drosophila involved in RNAi and transposon suppression.	Here, we show that recombinant Drosophila elp1 (D-elp1) produced in Sf9 cells or Escherichia coli, corresponding to the largest of the three subunits in the RNA polymerase II core elongator complex, has RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity. D-elp1 is a noncanonical RdRP that can synthesize dsRNA from different ssRNA templates using either a primer-dependent or primer-independent initiation mechanism. Of the three core subunits, only D-elp1 depletion inhibits RNAi in S2 cells but does not affect micro RNA function. Furthermore, D-elp1 depletion results in increased steady state levels of representative transposon RNAs and a decrease in the corresponding transposon antisense transcripts and endo siRNAs. In contrast, although Dcr-2 depletion results in increased transposon RNA levels and a reduction in the corresponding endo siRNAs, there is no change in the transposon antisense RNA levels. In D-elp1 null third instar larvae transposon RNA levels are also increased and the corresponding transposon antisense RNAs are reduced. D-elp1 associates tightly with Dcr-2, similar to the Dicer-RdRP interaction observed in lower eukaryotes. These results identify an aspect of the RNAi pathway in Drosophila that suggest transposon derived endo siRNAs, critical for transposon suppression, are produced, in part, in a D-elp1 dependent step that converts transposon RNA into dsRNA that is subsequently processed by Dcr-2. The generality of this mechanism in genome defense and RNA silencing in higher eukaryotes is suggested.
